## Bot Technical Requirements

### Computational Resources

Compute resources will increase in phases throughout the tournament:

1. **Phase 1** (until March 15, 11:59PM EST):
   - 1 vCPU
   - 2GB RAM per bot
   - 500 seconds time limit per match

2. **Phase 2** (March 16 - March 17, 11:59PM EST):
   - 2 vCPU
   - 4GB RAM per bot
   - 1000 seconds time limit per match

3. **Final Phase** (March 18 - March 20, 11:59PM EST):
   - 4 vCPU
   - 8GB RAM per bot
   - 1500 seconds time limit per match

All bots run in a Python 3.12 runtime environment on ARM64 architecture (AWS Graviton2).

### Time Constraints

- Each bot's time bank depends on the current phase (see above)
- Time bank depletes whenever the bot is computing an action
- If a bot's time bank is depleted during a match:
  - The match immediately ends
  - The bot automatically forfeits the match
  - The opponent is awarded the win

> **Important**: With 1000 hands per match, bots should aim to use their time efficiently to avoid depleting their time bank. For example, in the final phase with 1500 seconds, this means using no more than 1.5 seconds per hand on average.

## Game Variant

Our tournament uses a modified version of Texas Hold'em with unique features:

### Card Deck

- A **27-card deck**: three suits (♦ diamonds, ♥ hearts, ♠ spades) and nine ranks (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A). No face cards (10, J, Q, K) and no clubs. No jokers.

### Hand Rankings

From strongest to weakest:

1. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit
   - Example: 5♦ 6♦ 7♦ 8♦ 9♦
   - Example: A♦ 2♦ 3♦ 4♦ 5♦ (Ace can be low)
   - Example: 6♦ 7♦ 8♦ 9♦ A♦ (Ace can be high)

2. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair
   - Example: 7♦ 7♥ 7♠ 4♦ 4♥

3. **Flush**: Five cards of the same suit
   - Example: 2♦ 4♦ 6♦ 8♦ 9♦

4. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of any suit
   - Example: 5♦ 6♥ 7♦ 8♠ 9♥
   - Example: A♦ 2♥ 3♠ 4♦ 5♥ (Ace can be low)
   - Example: 6♦ 7♥ 8♠ 9♦ A♥ (Ace can be high)

5. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank
   - Example: 8♦ 8♥ 8♠ 2♦ 3♥

6. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs
   - Example: 9♦ 9♥ 3♦ 3♥ 8♠

7. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank
   - Example: A♦ A♥ 7♦ 4♠ 2♥

8. **High Card**: Highest single card
   - Example: A♦ 8♠ 6♥ 4♦ 2♠

> **Special Ace Rule**: The Ace (A) can be used as either high (above 9) or low (below 2) when forming straights and straight flushes.
>
> **Note**: Four-of-a-kind is impossible with this deck (only three suits).

### Discard Rule

- Each player will initially draw 5 cards
- After the flop is dealt out, players will discard down to 2 cards in betting order
- Once all players have made discards, flop betting will start
- Discarded cards are revealed to the opponent
- Discarded cards are removed from play for that hand
